# Web-Design-Challenge

Background
Data becomes more powerful when you share it with others! That’s because people can use your data only if they can access it. So, you’ll use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

Latitude logo at the top left corner can be clicked on to return to home page as well as an option listed at the bottom of the drop down box.

Plot graphs regenerated to modify colours to match with website theme addition text to the graph have been extracted from various websites for presentation purposes.

Html pages have been saved in the main folder and the visualisation folder
